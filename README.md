ASHELL - Simple Linux-based shell implementation that interprets and executes command line instructions. Supports commands such as `cd` `pwd` `exit` and handles redirection and pipes. Utilizes various system calls such as `fork` `execv` `dup2` and `wait` for process creation, command execution, and inter-process communication.

Parallel Sorting - Merge sort implementation that utilizes parallelism to speed up performance on multi-core processor machines needing to sort large datasets.

RPC - UDP based RPC server implementation. Created a mock client and server with a fully fledged call table. Implemented with a multi-threaded approach for parallel processing.

xv6-write-on-copy - project built on top of the unix-based xv6 operating system. Implementation of copy-on-write optimization.
